Hey Quinny!
As expected, I am very impressed and excited about your submission! AMAZING job, keep up the good work.


I've left some comments below and more in your code, I have left more comments in your code starting with "Sarah comment" / "Sarah's comment"

- Your hover effects are awesome! You might want to try adding more anumations to them next time. (like a like that fades or draws in etc.)
- HTML is so clean, semantic and accessible
- Very impressed that you made the site responsive
- Your CSS is very well organized and clean, although don't forget the rule of inception - never select more then 3 levels deep. (eg. section.research .num h6 is a little too specific. Something like .research h6 would be better)
- I think you would LOVE SCSS! Defintiely worth a try for project 3
- Your media queries look great!
